this is a pythin script for doing auto transaction with random amount of ETH transfer between two address.

**** Replace the placeholders Your_Private_Key, Sender_Address, and Receiver_Address with your private key, sender address, and receiver address respectively.

****Please be cautious when using private keys and never share them with anyone. Also, remember that this script generates random amounts of ETH for sending, so use it only for testing purposes on networks like Goerli.
